# HONEYPOT

## Objective
Deployed a low-interaction honeypot to capture and analyze automated attack patterns. Monitored traffic, logged intrusion attempts, and identified common exploits and attacker origins.

### Skills Learned

- Deployed and maintained a low-interaction honeypot to capture attack activity
- Monitored and analyzed network traffic to identify automated attack patterns
- Logged and investigated intrusion attempts for forensic insights
- Detected common exploits and mapped attacker techniques
- Tracked attacker origins and correlated with geolocation/IP data
- Enhanced expertise in threat detection, log analysis, and security monitoring

### Tools Used

- Honeypot framework (e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea, or Honeyd)
- Wireshark / tcpdump for packet capture and traffic analysis
- Splunk / ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation and visualization
- GeoIP lookup tools for attacker origin tracking
- Python / Bash for log parsing and automation
